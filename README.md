<h2>Java Stream API - Main Methods</h2>

<p>This repository contains a series of challenges to practice and deepen your knowledge of the powerful Java Stream API. Below, you will find a list of challenges that involve operations with streams to exercise your skills and creativity.</p>

<h2>List of Integer Numbers</h2>

<p>For all challenges, we will use the following list of integer numbers:</p>

<pre>
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5, 4, 3);
</pre>

<h2>Challenge 1 - Display the list in numerical order:</h2>

<p>Create a program that uses the Stream API to sort the list of numbers in ascending order and display it in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 2 - Print the sum of the even numbers in the list:</h2>

<p>Using the Stream API, calculate the sum of the even numbers in the list and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 3 - Check if all numbers in the list are positive:</h2>

<p>With the help of the Stream API, check if all numbers in the list are positive and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 4 - Remove all odd values:</h2>

<p>Use the Stream API to remove the odd values from the list and print the resulting list in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 5 - Calculate the average of numbers greater than 5:</h2>

<p>Using the Stream API, calculate the average of the numbers greater than 5 and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 6 - Check if the list contains any numbers greater than 10:</h2>

<p>Use the Stream API to check if the list contains any numbers greater than 10 and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 7 - Find the second largest number in the list:</h2>

<p>With the help of the Stream API, find the second largest number in the list and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 8 - Sum the digits of all numbers in the list:</h2>

<p>Using the Stream API, calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers in the list and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 9 - Check if all numbers in the list are distinct (do not repeat):</h2>

<p>With the Stream API, check if all numbers in the list are distinct (do not repeat) and display the result in the console.</p>

<h2>Challenge 10 - Group the odd values multiples of 3 or 5:</h2>

<p>Use the Stream API to group the odd values that are multiples of 3 or 5 and display the result in the console.</p>
